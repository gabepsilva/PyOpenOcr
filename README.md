PyOpenOCR makes it simple to host your own OCR REST API.

The heavy lifting OCR work is handled by [Tesseract 4 OCR](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/).

Run the service in your own computer or use [Docker](http://www.docker.io) to containerize.

In Tesseract 4.00 The memory usage is light. It is less fast than tesseract 3 and more costly in term of size (an simple aws instance with 1GB of ram is sufficient but with an EBS of 16GB of storage). Result are really better compared to version 3.04.
To see a comparative you can have a look to the [official page of tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/4.0-Accuracy-and-Performance)

You are now ready to decode images â†’ text via your REST API.



**Request with image base64**

```bash
#convert image to base 64
$ base64 image_test.png > /tmp/image_test.png.txt
$ curl -k -X POST https://localhost:443/ocr-base64 \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "@/tmp/image_test.png.txt"
  ```

```shell
$curl -k -X POST https://localhost:443/ocr-url \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "https://github.com/gabrielpsilva/pyopenocr/blob/master/image_test.png"
```


**Passing parameters to Tesseract**

You can pass parameters using in the url request:
$curl -k -X POST https://localhost:443/ocr-base64?psm=2&oem=3&lang=eng \
